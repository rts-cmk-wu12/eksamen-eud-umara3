# summery of kode

This is a client-side componenet that allow user to subscribe to a newsletter by entering their email. useState is hook to manage state: the user email input and a status message that provides feedback during and after submission. Once a valid email is provided, the component send a POST request to API endpoint with email address in JSON format, based on response it updates the status weather the subscription was success or not, e.g server issue or faild request.On success , it also clears input.UI with an input,submission button, and paragraph element that displays stusts messages dynamically.
